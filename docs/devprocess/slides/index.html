```
1. Do you use source control?
2. Can you make a build in one step?
3. Do you make daily builds?
4. Do you have a bug database?
5. Do you fix bugs before writing new code?
6. Do you have an up-to-date schedule?
7. Do you have a spec?
8. Do programmers have quiet working conditions?
9. Do you use the best tools money can buy?
10. Do you have testers?
11. Do new candidates write code during their interview?
12. Do you do hallway usability testing?

> A score of 12 is perfect, 11 is tolerable, but 10 or lower and you've got serious problems. The truth is that most software organizations are running with a score of 2 or 3, and they need serious help, because companies like Microsoft run at 12 full-time.

# What is development chaos?

--

![cowboycoder](images/cowboy-coder.png)

--

- People do what they want (regardless of deadlines or vision)

--

- Failure to deliver ("Let's move this release, because...")

--

- Unpredictability

---

# Story Time
#### Suprise deployments

![surprise](images/surprise.gif)

---

# How can we fix this?

--

- Set a schedule

--

- Stick to the schedule

--

- STICK TO THE SCHEDULE!!!

--

- STICK TO THE ... Ok, I think you get it

---
class: center, middle

# Story time
#### Wait a minute... employees do actually take their vacation and they are prone to get sick?

![surprise](images/overtime.jpg)

---

# How can we fix this?

--

- Capacity planning

--

- Rough estimation

--

- Priorize

---

class: center, middle

# Story Time
#### You got a minute, right?

![yougotaminute](images/yougotaminute.jpg)

---

# How can we fix this?

--

- Software engineers need long uninterrupted amounts of time ("Flow")

--

- Try to reduce interruptions as much as possible

--

- Keep meetings to a minimum

--

- Prefer asynchronous communication

--

- Get rid of spontaneous meetings completely!

---
class: center, middle

# Story Time
#### But wasn't that bug fixed a long time ago?

![notsureifbug](images/notsureifbug.jpg)

---

# How can we fix this?

--

- Feature freeze

--

- Dedicated testing & bugfixing phase

--

- Priorize

---

# Let's compare notes

# Guidelines

--

#### Commit Guidelines
Why? Because we don't want 100+ commits that just say `stuff`

Examples: Atom Commit Guideline, Angular Commit Guideline

--

#### Linting
Why? Because everyone has their own opinion on where to put semi-colons and colons

Tools: JSHint, JSCS, ESLint

Examples: AirBnB guideline

---

# Guidelines

--

- Nobody pushes to master (unless the building is on fire)

--

- Create feature/bugfix/etc. in a separate branch

--

- Pull request

--

- Git Flow or Github Flow

---

# Continous Integration & Continous Delivery

--

- Unit Tests

--

- Push -> Lint + Test on CI Server -> Build on CI Server -> Deploy

---

# Dedicated planning phase

--

- No coding allowed

--

- Write down requirements and its acceptance criteria

--

- Estimate

---

# Software engineers are particularly bad at estimation

--

> "Show me a software engineer who's good at estimation and I'll show you a software without bugs" - Old chinese proverb

--

- We are bad at estimating "big" things (Example: User wants to export a CSV file)

--

- We are good at estimating "small" things (Example: Add a modal dialog)

--

- Solution: Break down big things into smaller ones

--

- Ideally, one small thing should only take a couple of hours max
